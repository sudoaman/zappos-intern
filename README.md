As a child i have always wanted to draw things with hand and failed most of the time , i was bad at art. 
When i started learning computers i realized i can draw digitaly using digital language, this is where
i grew interest in becoming a front end developer. In this website i have used bootstrap and jQuery as
I have some experience in using them and they are very easy to use and implement. During the development 
process i used browser-sync with which it becomes very easy to code and see output without the need of 
refreshing the browser.

During this project and while researching about Llama's i realized they are pretty cool.
